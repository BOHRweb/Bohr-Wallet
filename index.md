## Welcome to BoHr

BoHr Blockchain system and for blockchain developer or personal.

Bohr is to create an underlying application platform for blockchain development institutions. It fits all the necessary functions of a smart contract..

### ABOUT BOHR

BoHr is a decentralized currency that trades and invest with powerful blockchain applications.

BoHr is the future underlying application platform to promote the development of new block chain.

BoHr directly tackles the pain point of block chain industry's large-scale implementation, breaks down technical barriers with rapid smart contracts, unblocks market interaction with multi-dimensional ecological structure.

and takes the whole field defi ecology as the breakthrough point, so as to relieve the public chain market facing bottleneck stage and empower the decentralized business ecology.

### Roadmap

2020 Q1：BoHr Core 1.0, First release of BoHr Core software with BoHr BFT consensus, draft specifications.

2020 Q2：BoHr mobile wallets，Light BoHr wallets to allow voting and BoHr transfers from Android devices.

2021 Q1：enlarged the BoHr network and pre-seeded it with validators for Mainnet, helped to decentralize the initial distribution of BoHr coins, and distributed coins into the hands of people who are interested in participating in the project.

2021 Q2：Main Network Launch: BoHr Core 1.0 codebase has been finalised and the network was successfully launched.

2021 Q3：Staking pool software: A pool allows a group of people who do not have enough SEM to join their votes to have enough voting power to create new blocks as validators.

2021 Q4：Bohr distribution，BoHr is the native cryptocurrency of BoHr network. It has 3 main use cases: it used in governance and BFT consensus algorithm (voting for delegates); it is a fuel for running decentralised apps; it is a store of value and mean of payment.

2021 Q5：Development: BoHr JS SDK，BoHr JS SDK allows to securely interact with BoHr blockchain and thus build both client/browser and server side applications. It's supported in Node.js and most modern browsers.

2021 Q6：Development: Virtual machine and HD wallet - Testnet，In February 2021 the virtual machine has been successfully activated in Testnet enabling smart contracts in Solidity. Same release featured HD-wallets.

Future：Development: Web3 support，This will allow to use existing toolset and simplify the frontend development for Dapps.

Future：Development: Browser extensions，BoHr Keeper is an extension that allows users to securely interact with BoHr-enabled web services from the browser. Private keys are encrypted and stored within the extension and cannot be accessed by online dApps and services, making sure that users' funds are protected from malicious websites.

Future：Development: BoHr light desktop wallet，Light cross-platform wallet to speed up onboarding of new BoHr users without the need to download heavy blockchain unless they are validators.

Future：BoHr Developer Program，Public bounty program to incentivize development of new consumer-oriented apps on top of BoHr platform.

Future：Development: BoHr Core 2.0，This release features on-chain governance and DAOs with decentralized control of funds as their basis.Further governance of the network and upgrades to the software or blockchain state are left to the community.
